# sorting-visualizer

Hi fellow geeks, as the name suggests this a sorting-visualizer which helps us understand sorting techniques better. This project was inspired from Clement Mihailescu's sorting visualizer. 

You can find his Visualizer at https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer

My visualizer is not an optimized, bug free one. But it serves the purpose. Feel free to correct my code.
